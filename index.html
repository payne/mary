    Here are some public notes about Mary Payne, whose memory is a blessing.  
    </p>


    <p>
    Fifteen days after breaking her hip my Mom, Mary 93.9 yo, died of related complications ( pneumonia etc ).  
    </p>

    <p>Mary insisted on no funeral and no listing on an obituary website (e.g. Legacy).
        Deeply affected by the great depression and didn't want any money spent on unnecessary things.   
        Well, Mom, this GitHub page is free.
    </p>

    <p>If you want to make a charitable contribution that will make Mary smile, please give to 
    <a href=https://www.shareafare.org/>https://www.shareafare.org/</a> Mary & her husband, Glenn, would use this 
    service to take cab rides to doctors appointments and other places.  Mary loved the feeling of independece and not being a burdon.
